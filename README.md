building with chat GPT

Imagine you are a developer given requirements to build an application that can use secure ftp connection for data exchange, have capability to read data structured and semi structured data , load into SQLite tables, normalize data, have ability to merge tables  , perform calculations, give output as downloadable reports, have ability to configure business rules and apply them during etl. also want the ui be modern , simple and elegant  . 
Application Requirements:

Secure FTP Connection:

The application should support a secure FTP connection to facilitate data exchange with external systems securely.
Data Reading and Loading:

The application should be capable of reading both structured and semi-structured data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON, etc.).
The extracted data should be loaded into SQLite tables for further processing and analysis.
Data Normalization:

The application should have the ability to normalize the loaded data into appropriate table structures based on predefined data models or user-defined rules.
Normalization should ensure consistency, eliminate redundancy, and improve data integrity.
Table Merging:

The application should provide functionality to merge multiple SQLite tables based on specific criteria or relationships.
Merging tables should facilitate combining data from different sources to generate comprehensive datasets.
Calculations and Data Manipulation:

The application should support performing calculations and data manipulations on the loaded and merged data.
Users should be able to define custom calculations or apply built-in functions to derive new insights or transform the data.
Downloadable Reports:

The application should generate downloadable reports based on the processed and analyzed data.
Reports should be available in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, Excel, etc.) to cater to different user requirements.
Configuration of Business Rules:

The application should allow users to configure and manage business rules for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
Business rules could include data validation, transformation logic, data filtering, and other rule-based operations.
Modern and Elegant UI:

The application's user interface (UI) should have a modern, simple, and elegant design.
The UI should provide an intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate, configure, and interact with the application's features.




app.py python Copy code from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, render_template, redirect from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename import os import sqlite3

app = Flask(name)

Define a route for the home page
@app.route('/') def home(): # Connect to the SQLite database database_path = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'database.db') conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path) cursor = conn.cursor()

# Retrieve data from the database
cursor.execute('SELECT data FROM normalized_data')
rows = cursor.fetchall()
data_list = [row[0] for row in rows]

# Close the connection
conn.close()

# Get a list of file names in the "data" folder
data_folder = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'data')
filenames = [filename for filename in os.listdir(data_folder) if os.path.isfile(os.path.join(data_folder, filename))]

# Pass the data to the template
return render_template('index.html', data_list=data_list, filenames=filenames)
Define a route for receiving the uploaded data
@app.route('/', methods=['POST']) def index(): return jsonify({'message': 'Data uploaded successfully'})

@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST']) def upload_data(): uploaded_file = request.files['file'] filename = secure_filename(uploaded_file.filename) file_path = os.path.join('data', filename) # Path to the "data" folder

# Save the uploaded file to the "data" folder
uploaded_file.save(file_path)

# Redirect to the home page
return redirect('/')
@app.route('/delete/', methods=['DELETE']) def delete_file(filename): file_path = os.path.join('data', filename) # Path to the file in the "data" folder

if os.path.exists(file_path):
    os.remove(file_path)
    return jsonify({'message': 'File deleted successfully'})
else:
    return jsonify({'message': 'File not found'})
if name == 'main': app.run(debug=True) Description: The app.py file contains the Flask application that handles the routes and logic for the web application. It provides routes for the home page, file upload, file deletion, and receiving uploaded data. The home route connects to an SQLite database, retrieves data, and passes it to the template. The upload route saves the uploaded file to a "data" folder. The delete route deletes a specific file from the "data" folder.

load.py python Copy code import sqlite3

def load_data_into_database(data): # Connect to the SQLite database database_path = 'database.db' conn = sqlite3.connect(database_path)

# Create a cursor object to execute SQL queries
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table if it doesn't exist
cursor.execute('''
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS normalized_data (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
        data TEXT
    )
''')

# Insert the normalized data into the database
cursor.execute('INSERT INTO normalized_data (data) VALUES (?)', (data,))

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
Description: The load.py file provides a function load_data_into_database that takes normalized data as input and loads it into an SQLite database. It connects to the database, creates a table if it doesn't exist, and inserts the data into the table. Finally, it commits the changes and closes the connection.

normalize.py python Copy code def normalize_data(data): # Perform normalization operations on the data # Normalize, merge, calculate based on business rules, etc. normalized_data = data.upper() # Example: Convert data to uppercase

return normalized_data
Description: The normalize.py file contains a function normalize_data that takes data as input and performs normalization operations on it. The specific operations can vary based on business rules or requirements. The provided example converts the data to uppercase, but you can modify this function to perform the necessary normalization operations.

Description: The index.html file is a template for the home page of the Flask application. It uses Bootstrap for styling and includes a form for uploading files and a list to display the uploaded files. The JavaScript code to handle file deletion is not provided and needs to be implemented based on your specific requirements. You can add the JavaScript code in the designated section indicated by .
Make sure to review the code, customize it as per your requirements, and handle any potential security considerations or error scenarios specific to your application.
