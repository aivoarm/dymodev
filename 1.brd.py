Building with chat GPT

Imagine you are a developer given requirements to build an application that can use secure ftp connection for data exchange, have capability to read data structured and semi structured data , load into SQLite tables, normalize data, have ability to merge tables  , perform calculations, give output as downloadable reports, have ability to configure business rules and apply them during etl. also want the ui be modern , simple and elegant  . 
Application Requirements:

Secure FTP Connection:

The application should support a secure FTP connection to facilitate data exchange with external systems securely.
Data Reading and Loading:

The application should be capable of reading both structured and semi-structured data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON, etc.).
The extracted data should be loaded into SQLite tables for further processing and analysis.
Data Normalization:

The application should have the ability to normalize the loaded data into appropriate table structures based on predefined data models or user-defined rules.
Normalization should ensure consistency, eliminate redundancy, and improve data integrity.
Table Merging:

The application should provide functionality to merge multiple SQLite tables based on specific criteria or relationships.
Merging tables should facilitate combining data from different sources to generate comprehensive datasets.
Calculations and Data Manipulation:

The application should support performing calculations and data manipulations on the loaded and merged data.
Users should be able to define custom calculations or apply built-in functions to derive new insights or transform the data.
Downloadable Reports:

The application should generate downloadable reports based on the processed and analyzed data.
Reports should be available in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV, Excel, etc.) to cater to different user requirements.
Configuration of Business Rules:

The application should allow users to configure and manage business rules for the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
Business rules could include data validation, transformation logic, data filtering, and other rule-based operations.
Modern and Elegant UI:

The application's user interface (UI) should have a modern, simple, and elegant design.
The UI should provide an intuitive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate, configure, and interact
