1. Project Analysis and Planning:
   a. Define project goals and requirements.
   b. Identify stakeholders and gather their input.
   c. Create a detailed project plan, including milestones and deliverables.
   d. Allocate resources and define roles and responsibilities.
   e. Determine the technologies and tools to be used.

2. User Interface (UI) Design:
   a. Conduct user research to understand user needs and preferences.
   b. Create wireframes and prototypes for the UI.
   c. Design a modern, simple, and elegant user interface.
   d. Ensure the UI is intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly.
   e. Incorporate branding elements, if applicable.

3. Secure FTP Connection:
   a. Implement a secure FTP client library or use existing solutions.
   b. Develop features to establish a secure connection to the FTP server.
   c. Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, SSH keys).
   d. Handle secure file transfers (uploading and downloading).

4. Data Processing and ETL:
   a. Develop a module to read structured and semi-structured data formats (e.g., CSV, XML, JSON).
   b. Implement data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.
   c. Develop a data normalization module to ensure data consistency.
   d. Implement data merging and table creation in SQLite.
   e. Design and apply business rules and validations during the ETL processes.

5. Reporting and Calculation:
   a. Develop a module to generate downloadable reports.
   b. Implement report templates with customizable options.
   c. Incorporate data visualization techniques (e.g., charts, graphs) for better insights.
   d. Develop calculations and aggregations based on user-defined requirements.
   e. Allow users to configure and save report settings for future use.

6. Security and Authentication:
   a. Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   b. Ensure proper encryption and protection of sensitive data.
   c. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user actions.
   d. Apply best practices for securing the application and its data.

7. Testing and Quality Assurance:
   a. Develop unit tests for each module and functionality.
   b. Perform integration testing to ensure components work together.
   c. Conduct system testing to validate the application's behavior.
   d. Perform performance testing to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
   e. Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
   f. Address and fix any identified bugs and issues.

8. Deployment and Maintenance:
   a. Prepare the application for deployment in a production environment.
   b. Configure necessary infrastructure (servers, databases, etc.).
   c. Deploy the application and ensure its proper functioning.
   d. Monitor and maintain the application's performance and security.
   e. Provide ongoing support and bug fixes as needed.
   f. Continuously gather user feedback for future improvements.

9. Documentation and Training:
   a. Create detailed documentation, including installation and user guides.
   b. Develop training materials and conduct training sessions for end-users.
   c. Provide technical documentation for developers and system administrators.

10. Project Management and Collaboration:
    a. Use project management tools for task tracking and progress monitoring.
    b. Foster effective communication among team members and stakeholders.
    c. Regularly review and update the project plan as needed.
    d. Conduct periodic meetings to discuss project status and address challenges.

By following this development plan, you can create an application that utilizes a secure FTP connection for data exchange, performs data processing and ETL tasks, generates reports, and applies business rules. The modern, simple, and elegant UI will provide a seamless user experience, and the application.

You task is to follow the plan and provide code for each of the  components and at a time. You need to ask for code logic review, and adjust per user input. Get confirmation of the final code.
